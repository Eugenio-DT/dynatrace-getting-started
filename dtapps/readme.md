# Community Developed Dynatrace Apps

This is the space where Dynatrace community members can share their custom built [Dynatrace Apps](https://developer.dynatrace.com/).
As more Dynatrace users built their own Dynatrace Apps we want to provide an easy way to share those with the global community

If you have an app to share [send us a note](mailto:devrel@dynatrace.com?subject=Custom%20App), create an Issue or a Pull Request on this repo by adding a new subfolder with your source code, description and app package
