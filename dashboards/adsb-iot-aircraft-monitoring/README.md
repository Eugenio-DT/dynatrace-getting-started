## How to Use

1. Set up the hardware and configure it to send the `aircraft.json` logs to Dynatrace by following the steps [outlined](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/leverage-edge-iot-data-with-opentelemetry-and-dynatrace/).
2. Download the JSON files from this repository.
3. Import the JSON files into your Dynatrace environment.
4. Customize the dashboards as needed to suit your monitoring requirements.

For more details on setting up and using these dashboards, please refer to the blog post linked above.
