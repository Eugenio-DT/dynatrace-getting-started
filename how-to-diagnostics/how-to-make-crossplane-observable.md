# How to Make Crossplane Observable

Build trust in your platform by quickly achieving Crossplane observability with our step-by-step instructions and sample
dashboard.

This was inspired by the
talk [Crossplane Observability at KubeCon 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/grabnerandi_observability-crossplane-kubecon-activity-7186289956489744384-AUzV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
